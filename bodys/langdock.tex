Langdock’s product-led, customer-facing path for technical builders is exactly where I do my best work. Your AI platform and focus on assistants/workflows align with my recent LLM and RAG experience, and the rotation’s mix of product depth and customer exposure matches how I learn—quickly, collaboratively, and with measurable impact.

In my master’s thesis, I built an experimental RAG database and an LLM agent for interactive data analysis using Python, APIs, vector stores, and cloud services. I apply MLOps practices—CRISP‑ML(Q), CI/CD, evaluation and monitoring—to ship reliably. In research at KISS and MIR, I turned domain needs into usable AI—from prompt‑engineering curricula to geospatial ML (Springer 2023). At KPMG and Deutsche Bahn, I led workshops and onboarding in German and English, anchoring value in evaluation harnesses and adoption analytics.

In Month 1 I’d master Langdock, run onboarding, and publish reusable templates for common enterprise copilots. Month 2: build guarded assistants and RAG workflows with feedback loops and tests. Month 3: support pilots, map capabilities to stakeholder goals, and quantify impact—helping the team win trust without old‑school sales. I’m ready to contribute on-site in Berlin and grow into Solutions Engineering or Customer Success.
