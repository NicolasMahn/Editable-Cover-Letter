Atira’s mission to give sales and mechanical engineers an AI-first, auditable quoting workflow—built from engineers for engineers—resonates with me. The hard part isn’t text generation; it’s embedding engineering rules and feasibility constraints into agents that span CAD/BOM, datasheets, and ERP/PLM/CPQ, while exposing uncertainty and keeping recommendations traceable—the problems I like to solve.

For my double M.Sc. thesis I’m building a multi-tool LLM agent with retrieval pipelines, function calling, tool orchestration, and an evaluation harness. As a Research Associate I prototyped an experimental RAG database and authored prompt-engineering materials; at KPMG and Deutsche Bahn I delivered containerized services, data pipelines, and CI/CD for AI infrastructure. I also bring manufacturing context—lean production (flow/takt/pull, Kanban), job-shop dispatching, and pragmatic use of simulations/digital twins—so systems degrade gracefully with clear assumptions and confidence.

At Atira I’d translate this into a Sales-Engineer Copilot that retrieves across CAD/BOM/datasheets, applies engineering rules via tools, and integrates with ERP/PLM/CPQ; feasibility-aware quoting that uses simulations when available; and reliable iteration through gold-set evaluation, consistency checks, telemetry, and fast A/B loops. I value small teams with high ownership and a Made-in-Germany quality mindset, and I’m ready to contribute in Munich in German or English.
