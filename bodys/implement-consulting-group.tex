Implement’s people-centered approach to turning strategy into tangible results resonates with how I work. I’m most motivated by the intersections of digital IT delivery and agility, projects and implementation, and leading digital change—designing data/AI solutions iteratively, translating strategy into clear delivery plans, and enabling adoption through transparent communication and feedback.

In my double M.Sc., I built an LLM-agent system for interactive data analysis and developed an experimental RAG database and prompt-engineering materials used in courses and workshops. At KPMG and Deutsche Bahn, I supported digital finance and AI infrastructure initiatives, helping teams align stakeholders, clarify requirements, and implement solutions with governance and documentation that endure beyond pilots. I’m comfortable switching between Excel/PowerPoint and Python/ML/NLP, and I’ve facilitated agile rituals (sprint reviews, show-and-tells, retros) to build shared ownership. My publications—on geospatial ML for urban mobility (Springer, 2023) and decision support (CEUR, 2025)—reflect a habit of turning complex analysis into decision-ready insights.

I’m available 2–3 days per week from winter 2025 and plan to graduate in 2025, with interest in transitioning to a full-time consultant role. As a small signal of my working style, I organized this application using my own agentic RAG-based LLM pipeline—tools I’ve built, taught, and continuously refine.
